#The Elements of Computer Systems -- Projects

This is where I store my completed projects for the book titled above.
This is the same book used in the From Nand 2 Tetris course.

Now here's a few answers to some questions I'm sure I (or somebody) will ask when viewing this.

**Why have both projects and completed-projects instead of one directory?**
For chapters 1-6 the authors recommended using the BuiltIn chips instead of the student-built chips for numerous reasons so I just made another directory to save my implementations.

**Why are the tools saved if they're available on the course's website too?**
For convenience. There were issues with the tools on the download page and I found the updated tools were within the forums, but a specific thread for some reason. This was from a while ago.

**Why are the compiled files included?**
Probably because I'm a dummy and forgot about them or forgot to ignore them.

**Where's the history to the files before Chapter 7?**
Hahaha, so I originally thought, "Since this is a course I'll just follow through on my local machine and not worry about versioning anything", but after Chapter 6 I started refactoring my code a bit and thought, "Hey! I should version this so I can easily revert back and see how my code's changed over time!". And here we are.

**Why didn't you use this feature of Python to solve that problem?**
I'm using this project to learn more about Python too (used it way ago and trying to pick a bit of it back up again). Feel free to message me with any suggestions! Or even if you just want to say hi!
